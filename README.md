# Hamza Ilyas - Curriculum Vitae

My personal & professional CV documenting my journey. Born in Pakistan, Okara Cantt, I moved to Italy early in life. From there, I traveled around Europe and did an Erasmus exchange in England. I worked at Whirlpool in Varese before moving to Turin for my Master's at Politecnico di Torino. My adventures continued from Turin to Milan, traveling the West Coast from La Spezia to Saint Tropez. In the 1st semester of 2024-2025, I did another Erasmus in Argentina at Universidad Nacional de Córdoba. Currently, I am in Reggiolo, Italy for 2025.
