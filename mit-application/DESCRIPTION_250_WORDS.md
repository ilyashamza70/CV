# Relevant Experience Description

I'm a 25-year-old Pakistani computer engineer completing my MSc at Polytechnic of Turin, specializing in embedded systems. My journey from Faisalabad to becoming a Field Service Engineer at Tomra Recycling in Italy demonstrates sustained technical excellence across borders and disciplines.

My foundation began at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (UniMoRE), where I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. The rigorous curriculum developed my understanding of low-level hardware-software integration, culminating in a thesis that bridged theoretical computer science with practical embedded applications. This work established my passion for systems where computational efficiency meets physical constraints.

Professionally, I've balanced academic pursuits with real-world engineering at Tomra Recycling, a Norwegian multinational pioneering sensor-based sorting technology. As a Field Service Engineer, I troubleshoot complex electromechanical systems, optimize sensor arrays, and implement firmware updates across industrial installations. Concurrently, my consulting work with FKUnited Inc. allows me to architect custom embedded solutions for international clients, sharpening my ability to translate technical requirements into deployable systems.

At Politecnico di Torino, my Master's coursework delves deeper into advanced embedded architectures, real-time operating systems, and hardware security—topics that align directly with MIT's distinguished research strengths. My Erasmus semester in Argentina and extended time in England expanded my perspective on global engineering challenges and collaborative problem-solving across cultural contexts.

This unique combination of technical depth, entrepreneurial consulting experience, and international mobility—evidenced by multiple work visas across Italy and Europe—positions me to contribute meaningfully to MIT's graduate community while pursuing cutting-edge research in next-generation embedded systems and IoT security.
